# Requirements Prod v1.0
- The dev experience should be "simple" (single click) and "fast" (Less than 15 minutes to create the environment).
- Ability to config repro capability (saving data for later machine creation on failure) to repro the failure.
- Ability to request a job to repro (automatically creates the environment).
- Must work for Windows, Linux, Mac, and ARM (ARM machines not available).
- Needs to work for both Jenkins and Helix.
- The solution is for devs who work at Microsoft only.
- Checking out a machine comes with sufficient data and access to connect and configure.
- The machine should be delivered in a known state which can reasonably be setup to repro.
- Prereqs are either installed, or verified to be installed.
- Exact hash is restored (GitHub is what's initially supported).
- Matching symbols - especially for when we find a way to NOT rebuild the product.
- Provide method to move files onto/off-of machine.
- Support retention policy for the snapshot/workspace data.
- Decommision once dev indicates they are complete with repro.
- Devs need the ability to list all environments they've asked for, including current state (e.g. if they're ready or not).
- Be able to reasonably produce a "report" of all outstanding environments and their age and dev.
