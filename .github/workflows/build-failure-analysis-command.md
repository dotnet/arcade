name: "Build Failure Analysis (command)"
description: >-
  Rerun the build-failure analysis on a pull request when a maintainer comments
  `/analyze-build-failure`. Same body as `build-failure-analysis.md` — it does
  NOT rebuild: it inspects the PR's **latest** Azure Pipelines `arcade-pr`
  build and, **only when that latest build has failed** (it stops if the
  newest build is still running or has succeeded), downloads the binary logs
  that build already produced (all build legs) and delegates to the
  `build-failure-analyst` agent (which queries the binlogs live via the
  containerized `binlog-mcp` MCP server). Useful when a previous run was
  cancelled, the analysis comment was dismissed, or the agent needs another
  pass. Like the auto workflow it performs **no build**; the generated jobs do
  check out the repository (and, for the slash-command event, the PR branch)
  for agent tooling only — the PR's code is never built or executed.

  # Gate the AI pipeline on the fetch job so the agent only runs when a binlog

# PR's latest Azure DevOps build did not fail, or the PR is out of scope.
if: needs.fetch-binlog.outputs.binlog-found == 'true'

# Least-privilege for the workflow/agent jobs. The agent runs read-only; it
# does NOT post directly. All PR writes it produces (summary comment + inline
# review suggestions) go through gh-aw **safe-outputs**, which the compiler
# emits as a separate `safe_outputs` job granted `pull-requests: write` +
# `issues: write` in the generated lock. (The slash-command trigger also adds
# an acknowledgement reaction to the command comment; gh-aw emits that in its
# own generated job with the scope it needs — it is not driven by this agent
# job.) Keep `pull-requests: read` here so the AI agent job stays
# least-privilege — do NOT raise it to `write`, that would hand PR-write scope
# to the agent job unnecessarily.
#
# Do NOT add `copilot-requests: write` here. That permission switches gh-aw's
# generated lock from `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN }}`
# to `${{ github.token }}`, and the ephemeral Actions token is not entitled for
# inference against api.githubcopilot.com in this org — every agent run then
# dies in ~2s with "Authentication failed with provider ... (HTTP 403)" on both
# /models and /chat/completions, before it reads the prompt or opens a binlog.
# `update-default-versions.md` omits it and works; keep this consistent.

# Live binlog access for the agent — see build-failure-analysis.md for the
# rationale. The fetch-binlog job downloads each build leg's binlog from Azure
# DevOps into a directory and uploads it; the agent job downloads it to
# `/tmp/binlogs` and the gh-aw MCP gateway mounts it read-only at
# `/data/binlogs`.
#
# NOT pinned by digest, and that is a gh-aw v0.77.5 limitation, not a choice.
# This container is handed the binlogs of an unmerged, possibly external PR and
# its output is what the agent reports back, so "whatever this tag points at
# today" is a supply-chain decision made by whoever last pushed the tag — and
# the tag does move: it resolved to sha256:9f1e2c3e8281... from 2026-07-16
# until 2026-08-03, when it became
# sha256:ee7b7e5c6e162f3f0061822aa7183260626f1a1e986d04ba9915ab197a37932c.
# v0.77.5 validates `container` against `^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9/:_.-]*$`, which
# has no `@`, so `image@sha256:...` is rejected at compile time and the
# generated `download_docker_images.sh` pulls this image by bare tag while every
# other image in the lock is digest-pinned. gh-aw >= v0.83.x resolves and pins
# the digest automatically (verified: microsoft/testfx on v0.83.4 emits
# `digest` + `pinned_image` in its `gh-aw-manifest` and pulls by `@sha256:`), so
# this is fixed by bumping the compiler this repo pins rather than by editing
# this line.

# Custom job that reuses the binlogs from the PR's most recent failed Azure
# DevOps `arcade-pr` build instead of rebuilding. Mirrors the fetch-binlog job
# in build-failure-analysis.md; it locates the build by the PR's merge branch
# (no `check_run` payload is available on a slash command).

    name: Fetch binlogs (Azure Pipelines)
    # Cheap pre-gate. This job is a dependency of gh-aw's `pre_activation`, so it
    # runs BEFORE the role / command-position check. Without a guard it would
    # download hundreds of MB of binlogs on *every* comment in the repository,
    # which any public commenter could trigger repeatedly. This expression is
    # only the free first filter — `author_association` is coarse (in an
    # org-owned repo every org member reports MEMBER regardless of the
    # permission they actually hold here), so the step below resolves the
    # commenter's real repository permission before anything is downloaded.
    # `pre_activation` remains the authoritative role + command-position check,
    # and `activation` additionally requires `binlog-found == 'true'`.
    #
    # KEEP IN SYNC with `roles:` in the frontmatter above. The author_association
    # list here and the permission step below are hand-written restatements of
    # that policy; editing `roles:` does NOT update them, because only
    # `pre_activation` is generated from the frontmatter.
    #
    # `github.event.issue.pull_request` is what keeps plain issue comments out:
    # gh-aw emits no such filter of its own despite `events: [pull_request_comment]`
    # (checked in the generated lock), so PR-only scoping is a property of this
    # hand-written expression rather than something the compiler enforces. It
    # degrades safely without it — `repos/.../pulls/<issue#>` 404s and the script
    # emits no binlog — but it would pay for a runner first.
    #
    # `contains(..., '/analyze-build-failure')` is a substring match anywhere in
    # the body, whereas the authoritative `check_command_position` requires the
    # command to be in a valid position. So a write-access user merely mentioning
    # the command, or editing an old comment that quotes it (`types:` includes
    # `edited`), still starts this job. Workflow `if:` expressions have no
    # regex, and `startsWith` would reject the leading whitespace/newlines gh-aw
    # accepts, so this stays a deliberate over-approximation — but it is now
    # only a cheap pre-filter: the first step of the job reproduces gh-aw's real
    # first-token check and bails out before anything is downloaded.
