# Custom Version of the Xunit Console Runner

## Origin/Attribution

## Significant Changes
* Added Response File parsing to `src/CommandLine.cs`
* Fixed racing condition in `src/common/AssemblyResolution/DependencyContextAssemblyCache.cs` that manifests themself as
```

An operation is not legal in the current state. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131509 (COR_E_INVALIDOPERATION))
