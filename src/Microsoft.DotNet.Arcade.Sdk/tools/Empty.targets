    Implement this file to specify more targets that must be suppressed to allow projects to
    participate in the build without doing anything.

    For example, if a project specifies '<Target Name="CustomTarget" BeforeTargets="Build"> ...', it
    could cause failures if it relies on Restore assets that were suppressed. The custom target must
    also be suppressed to prevent build failure. The repo would create eng/Empty.targets and add a
    line '<Target Name="CustomTarget" />'.
