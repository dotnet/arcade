  <!-- The VSSDK immplements these targets. Since their name ends with OutputGroup,
       these targets get run during design time builds per convention. If the Project
       is not a VSIX project and sets $CreateVSIXContainer=false these targets should be
       a no-op. However they dont check for that and that's a bug. To workaround, we override them
       with empty targets and conditionally import these if CreateVSIXContainer is false.
