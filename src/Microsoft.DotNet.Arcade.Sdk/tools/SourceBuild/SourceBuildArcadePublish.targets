    If an inner source-build attempts to publish its packages, they could find their way onto a dev
    feed and be used unintentionally by downstream repos and devs, or the duplicate packages could
    break the build in a confusing way. This target should detect this and break the build in a
    clear way, instead.

    If this happens, it's likely caused by incompatible build scripts vs. the source-build job
    template. Publish may need to be disabled in eng/SourceBuild.props.
