# Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Packaging

Task package which will handle building projects with the extension pkgproj like the ones we currently have on our [corefx](http://github.com/dotnet/corefx/) and [core-setup](http://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/) repos. This package also includes the tasks that will do validation to make sure the packages will not break support of any existing framework.
