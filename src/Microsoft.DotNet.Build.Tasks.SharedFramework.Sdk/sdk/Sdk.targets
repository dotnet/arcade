    Like the Arcade SDK, this SDK doesn't import its dependencies here like a typical SDK would.
    Rather, the repo must import the Arcade SDK and the Arcade SDK's dependencies.

    See https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/238f1bbb23ba67616818d0b242c5b55a18edec55/Documentation/ArcadeSdk.md#directorybuildprops
