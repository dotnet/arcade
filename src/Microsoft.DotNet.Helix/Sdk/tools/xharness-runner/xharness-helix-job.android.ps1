<#
This script is used as a payload of Helix jobs that execute Android workloads through XHarness on Windows systems.
This is used as the entrypoint of the work item so that XHarness failures can be detected and (when appropriate)
cause the work item to retry and reboot the Helix agent the work is running on.

Currently no special functionality is needed beyond causing infrastructure retry and reboot if the emulators
or devices have trouble, but to add more Helix-specific Android XHarness behaviors, this is one extensibility point.
