# JobMonitorRunner — Technical Specification

This document is a behavioral specification of the Helix job monitor runner.
It describes *what* the runner must do, not *how* it currently does it.

The current source lives at [JobMonitorRunner.cs](JobMonitorRunner.cs); use
it only as the reference implementation, not as the specification.

---

## 1. Purpose

The runner is the body of a standalone CLI invoked as a single job inside an
Azure DevOps pipeline stage. Its job is to:

- Observe the Helix jobs submitted from the same build (by the Helix SDK
  submitter) and the Azure DevOps timeline jobs running alongside it.
- Resubmit failed Helix work items once per invocation.
- Upload Helix work-item test results to Azure DevOps.
- Return an exit code that reflects whether the monitored pipeline jobs and
  the latest completed Helix work items all succeeded.

## 2. Operating model

### 2.1 Stage scope

Each invocation owns exactly one Azure DevOps stage **attempt**. All decisions
(retry, completion gating, upload, pass/fail) consider only:

- Azure DevOps timeline jobs belonging to the monitor's stage.
- Helix jobs whose `System.StageName` property is empty (stage unknown) or
  matches the monitor's stage, **and** whose `System.StageAttempt` property is
  empty (attempt unknown) or matches the monitor's own stage attempt.

Jobs and work items from other stages — or from a previous attempt of the same
stage — must not be retried, uploaded, or used to fail this invocation.

Per-attempt scoping is deliberate. When a stage is retried, Azure DevOps re-runs
every job in the stage, including the Helix submitter jobs; those submitters
create brand new Helix jobs (stamped with the new stage attempt) covering all of
the stage's work again. A monitor running in attempt *N* therefore only tracks
attempt *N*'s Helix jobs; any unfinished or failed work from attempt *N-1* is
abandoned and re-driven by attempt *N*'s fresh submissions. This prevents a
retried monitor from re-discovering — and waiting out its full timeout on —
never-finishing work left behind by an earlier attempt (for example work items
permanently stranded in `Waiting`).

The monitor's own stage attempt is provided as an input (see §3) and defaults to
the `SYSTEM_STAGEATTEMPT` pipeline variable. When it is unknown the monitor falls
back to build + stage scope and tracks jobs from every attempt.

### 2.2 Durable state

The runner may crash, time out, or be retried at any point. Any behavior that
must survive a restart can only be reconstructed from durable external state:

- **Azure DevOps test-run tags** — when the monitor completes a test run it
  tags it with the Helix job name, encoded as `helixjob<guid-without-dashes>`
  (AzDO test-run tags must be alphanumeric and at most 50 characters). The
  presence of that tag on a completed test run is the durable signal that the
  corresponding Helix job's results have already been uploaded. Tags must be
  posted as objects (`{ "name": "..." }`); the string form is silently dropped.
  Tags are not returned inline on a run and are read back via the build-scoped
  test results tags endpoint on the `vstmr` host. The tag is applied at
  completion (not creation) so it exists if and only if the run completed and
  results finished uploading.
- **Helix job properties** — every resubmitted Helix job preserves the
  original submitter's properties and adds `PreviousHelixJobName`, linking
  to the job that was resubmitted. The chain of `PreviousHelixJobName`
  links represents the incarnations of one logical piece of work.

In-memory state may be used freely within a single invocation but must never
be the source of truth for cross-invocation correctness.

### 2.3 Retry invariants

1. Retry runs exactly once per invocation, on entry, before polling begins.
2. The set of work to resubmit is decided from a single Helix snapshot taken
   on entry. Work that fails after the monitor has started is not
   resubmitted during the current invocation; a later invocation may pick
   it up.
3. A Helix job is eligible for retry only if it is the latest completed
   incarnation in its lineage chain (not superseded by a newer attempt).
4. If that incarnation has failed work items, only the failed items are
   resubmitted; passing items are not.
5. If a newer incarnation of a work item has already completed and passed,
   no further resubmission for that item occurs.
6. If a newer incarnation is still running or waiting, no resubmission
   occurs.

Repeated monitor runs therefore submit progressively fewer work items as
newer incarnations succeed.

### 2.4 Upload invariants

Upload is restart-resilient but logically independent from retry.

1. The same Helix job's test results are never uploaded twice. The durable
   deduplication signal is the Helix-job-name tag on completed AzDO test runs.
2. For every completed Helix job not already uploaded, all available test
   results are uploaded.
3. Uploads happen in lineage order — oldest incarnation first. If both an
   original job and its resubmission have completed and neither has been
   uploaded, the original uploads first.
4. Upload failures are logged but never affect pass/fail.
5. A failed original Helix job may be resubmitted on entry and still have
   its original test results uploaded during the same invocation if those
   results were not uploaded earlier.

### 2.5 Pass/fail invariants

The exit code is determined by combining two checks:

- **AzDO side** — the monitor fails if any monitored AzDO job failed or
  was canceled. Jobs whose work is being actively retried this invocation
  are excluded from this check (their failure is represented by the
  resubmitted Helix work).
- **Helix side** — the monitor fails if the latest completed incarnation of
  any submitted work item failed. A newer passing incarnation supersedes an
  older failed one.

Upload state never affects pass/fail.

Exit code is `0` only when both checks pass; otherwise `1`. Cancellation
(timeout) also exits with `1`.

### 2.6 Crash and timeout resilience

The runner must be safe to re-run after any abrupt termination. In
particular:

- Partial uploads must not cause duplicate uploads on the next run.
- Retry candidates must be rediscovered from Helix job properties, not from
  prior in-memory state.
- Cancellation must drain in-flight uploads before exiting so partially
  uploaded results are not lost.
- On cancellation, in-flight Helix jobs should receive a best-effort cancel
  request even though the runner's own cancellation token has already
  fired. This requires a fresh, short-lived cancellation budget for the
  cleanup path.

This re-attach behavior is scoped to a re-run within the *same* stage attempt
(for example when only the monitor job is retried, or the monitor process
crashes and is restarted). A new stage attempt is a fresh start: it re-runs the
submitters and does not re-attach to the previous attempt's Helix jobs (§2.1).

## 3. Inputs

The runner is configured by an options object. The semantically meaningful
inputs are:

| Input | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Helix endpoint + access token | Talk to the Helix service. |
| Organization, project, repository, branch, build reason | Compose the Helix `source` filter (see §5.1). |
| Build ID | Scope Helix and AzDO queries to this build. |
| AzDO collection URI + project | Construct the test-results URL used in failure reports. |
| Stage name | Stage scope (see §2.1). |
| Stage attempt | Per-attempt scope (see §2.1). Defaults to `SYSTEM_STAGEATTEMPT`; when unknown the monitor tracks jobs from every attempt of the stage. |
| Polling interval | Delay between poll iterations; a minimum floor applies. |
| Maximum wait | Reported in the timeout message; the timeout itself is enforced by the caller through cancellation. |
| Job monitor name | Identifier of the monitor's own AzDO timeline record; used to exclude it from pass/fail. |
| Working directory | Local staging directory for downloaded test results. |
| Verbose flag | Forces a status snapshot every poll. |

## 4. External contracts

The runner depends on two service interfaces. The contracts are described
behaviorally; method names are illustrative.

### 4.1 Helix service

- **List jobs for a build** — given the source filter and build ID, return
  all Helix jobs that the submitter recorded for the build. The source
  filter must be derivable from build metadata in lockstep with the
  submitter (see §5.1). The returned set spans every attempt of the build;
  the runner narrows it to the current stage attempt itself (§2.1) using each
  job's `System.StageName` / `System.StageAttempt` properties.
- **List work items for a job** — return all work-item summaries.
- **Download test results** — given a job and a set of work-item names,
  download recognized result files into a working directory. Individual
  per-work-item failures must not abort the batch.
- **Cancel a job** — best-effort cancellation.
- **Resubmit failed work items** — given the original job and a set of
  failed work items, submit a new Helix job that contains only those items.
  The new job must inherit the original's submitter identity (stage, stage
  attempt, job name, display name, test-run name, queue) and link back via
  `PreviousHelixJobName`. May return "not possible" (e.g. queue gone), in
  which case the runner skips that retry.

### 4.2 Azure DevOps service

- **Get timeline records** — return the build's timeline.
- **Get processed Helix job names** — extract Helix job names from
  `helixjob<guid>` tags on completed test runs (read via the build-scoped
  test results tags endpoint). This is the durable upload-dedup signal.
- **Create test run / upload results / complete test run** — the standard three-call sequence. Creation always creates a new in-progress test run with a plain name; completion tags the run with the Helix job name. Durable deduplication is based on that completion-time tag (§2.2).

## 5. Behavior

### 5.1 Helix source filter

On entry the runner derives a Helix `source` string from the build metadata
(organization, project, repository, branch, build reason). This string must
match what the Helix SDK submitter produced for the same build — for PR,
scheduled, manual, IndividualCI, BatchedCI, and internal-official runs
alike. Any change in derivation must be made in lockstep with the submitter,
or the runner will silently fail to see its own jobs.

### 5.2 Lifecycle

1. Log the build and stage being monitored.
2. Load the set of already-uploaded Helix job names (§2.2).
3. Perform the one-shot retry pass (§5.3).
4. Enter the poll loop (§5.4) until the build finishes or cancellation
   fires.
5. On cancellation (timeout), drain pending uploads, emit a timeout report
   (§5.6), best-effort cancel in-flight Helix jobs (§2.6), and exit `1`.
6. On normal completion, emit the final summary and exit per §2.5.

### 5.3 Retry pass

1. Take a Helix snapshot scoped to the stage attempt.
2. Reduce it to the latest incarnation of each lineage chain.
3. For each completed latest incarnation that has failed work items, ask
   the Helix service to resubmit just the failed items.
4. Remember the AzDO submitter-job identifiers of successfully retried
   work; these are the jobs to exclude from the AzDO failure check while
   this invocation runs.
5. Carry the snapshot plus the newly resubmitted jobs forward as the input
   to the first poll iteration so the first iteration sees them
   immediately. (Subsequent iterations refetch from Helix.)

If nothing was eligible for retry, log that fact.

### 5.4 Poll loop

Each iteration:

1. Check for cancellation.
2. Fetch the AzDO timeline and the Helix snapshot, scoped to the stage attempt.
3. Update the in-memory view of each Helix job with the freshest snapshot
   (so completion/failure transitions are not missed).
4. Compute the set of completed Helix jobs (§5.5).
5. **First pass — upload**: for each completed Helix job not already
   uploaded (per §2.2), upload its test results and remember it as
   processed. This pass is the only one that triggers uploads.
6. **Second pass — outcome reconciliation**: for every completed Helix
   job in scope, ensure its per-work-item outcomes are reflected in the
   running outcome map (§5.7), processing lineage from oldest to newest so
   newer incarnations supersede older ones. This pass must consider all
   completed jobs — including ones uploaded by an earlier invocation —
   because the outcome map is the only source for the pass/fail decision
   and is not durable across invocations.
7. Decide whether to log status this iteration. The decision uses the
   verbose flag, whether any counts changed since the last status log, and
   a maximum interval (so long-stable builds still emit periodic progress).
8. Evaluate termination: all monitored AzDO jobs complete *and* all scoped
   Helix jobs in the completed set. When true, wait for pending uploads,
   emit the final report, and exit per §2.5.
9. Otherwise sleep for the configured poll interval and repeat.

### 5.5 Completion of a Helix job

A Helix job is considered complete when the Helix service reports it
finished or failed. As a fallback for jobs whose status transition has not
yet been observed, the runner may treat a job as complete when every one of
its expected work items has a terminal exit code. The fallback is only safe
when the expected work-item count is known and non-zero.

### 5.6 Timeout report

On cancellation, the runner emits two grouped reports:

- All scoped Helix jobs that are either not yet finished or finished but
  not yet uploaded — each with its display name, status, expected
  work-item count, and a clickable details URI.
- All scoped non-monitor AzDO timeline jobs not yet in `completed` state —
  each with its name, state, and result.

If both groups are empty, emit a single critical-level note that nothing
unfinished was tracked at the time of timeout (this means timeout fired
during the brief window between completion and termination).

### 5.7 Per-work-item outcome map

The runner maintains an in-memory map from *logical work item* to its
latest observed pass/fail status. A logical work item is identified by the
work-item name plus a stable key that survives resubmission, so all
incarnations of the same item collapse onto a single entry.

The chain key must be deterministic and uniqueness-preserving:

- A single AzDO matrix leg that fans out to multiple Helix queues must
  produce distinct keys (one per queue) so per-queue failures are
  preserved.
- An original Helix job and its resubmission(s) on the same queue must
  produce the same key so the latest incarnation overwrites the older one.
- If lineage cannot be resolved (the predecessor link points outside the
  jobs the runner has observed), the key falls back to a Helix-job-bound
  identifier so independent jobs don't collide.

The same key drives a parallel map of "failed work item console info" used
to build the final failure report. When a later incarnation of a work item
passes, its entry in that map is cleared.

### 5.8 Failure reporting

Failed Helix work items must produce clickable console-link warnings in the
AzDO build log:

- Once per failed work-item observation during status logs (deduplicated
  across the invocation so we don't spam the same link).
- Once per failed work item in a completed job during the upload pass
  (same dedup).
- At termination, a single aggregated error block listing every still-
  failing work item, prefixed with the test-results URL for the build.

Warnings use AzDO `task.logissue type=warning` formatting; the final
aggregated error uses `task.logissue type=error`. Informational status
lines are plain logger output.

### 5.9 Test-result upload pipeline

Uploads are fire-and-forget tasks tracked for later draining:

- Each upload is queued asynchronously and tracked. Multiple uploads may
  proceed concurrently.
- An upload retries indefinitely on transient errors; only cancellation
  exits the retry loop.
- Both the normal-termination and cancellation paths wait for queued
  uploads to drain before exiting. The cancellation drain uses a fresh
  cancellation budget so uploads in progress when the runner token fires
  are not abandoned.

The upload sequence per job is: create (or reuse) a test run with the plain
`{TestRunName}`, download results, upload them, complete the test run and tag
it with the Helix job name (`helixjob<guid>`).

### 5.10 Status logging

When a status log is due, the runner emits a one-line summary of work
counts (processed / completed / running / waiting jobs and work items). In
verbose mode it additionally emits a tree-style breakdown per job and work
item. The verbose tree is informational only.

A Helix job is classified for status purposes as `Processed` (already
uploaded), `Completed` (terminal but not yet uploaded), `Running` (has at
least one work item), or `Waiting` (no work items observed yet).

## 6. Externally observable formats

These shapes are observed by other tools, downstream parsers, or tests and
must be preserved:

- AzDO test-run tag: `helixjob<guid-without-dashes>`, applied to a completed
  test run as an object-form tag (`{ "name": "..." }`).
- AzDO log decorations: `##vso[task.logissue type=warning]` for warnings,
  `##vso[task.logissue type=error]` for errors. Informational lines use
  plain logger output (no `##vso` prefix).
- Test-results URL: the standard AzDO build-test-results-tab URL for the
  build, used as the link in the final failure block.
- A Helix work item is considered failed if its exit code is non-zero or
its state is not the terminal success state. A work item is considered
failed-and-terminal (worth reporting eagerly) when it is failed and not
still in flight.
