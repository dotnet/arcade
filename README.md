Notes: 
- Runtime and ASPNETCore had made significant changes in their repos that meant the LKG was not a good baseline to use for validation. This is being changed. 
- Received sign-off from both Runtime and ASPNETCore teams to promote this version of Arcade despite the issues in validating against those repos.
