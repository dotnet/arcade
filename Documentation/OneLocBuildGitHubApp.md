# Authenticating OneLocBuild's GitHub check-in with the GitHub App

This document explains how a repository gains access to the default **GitHub App**
authentication path for the OneLocBuild localization check-in PR. It supplements the main
[OneLocBuild in Arcade](OneLocBuild.md) documentation.

## Background

When OneLocBuild is configured for a GitHub-based repo (`RepoType: gitHub`), the task opens or
updates a pull request to check in localized files. The GitHub App authentication path mints a
short-lived installation token (`ghs_…`) at build time, avoiding a stored GitHub credential. The
repositories accessible to the token are determined by the GitHub App installation configuration
(all repositories or the selected repositories).
[GitHub installation tokens expire after one hour](https://docs.github.com/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-an-installation-access-token-for-a-github-app#generating-an-installation-access-token).

The GitHub App used for this is **`dotnet OneLoc Localization`** (owned by `@dotnet-bot`). Its only
job is to open/update the localization check-in PR on your repository.

## How it works

The App path is enabled by default. In
[`onelocbuild.yml`](/eng/common/core-templates/job/onelocbuild.yml), the App token is minted only
when **all** of the following are true:

- `UseGitHubAppAuthentication` is `true` (the default), **and**
- `RepoType` is `gitHub`, **and**
- the build is running in the **`dnceng/internal`** or **`DevDiv/DevDiv`** Azure DevOps project, or
  `UseGitHubAppAuthenticationInOtherProjects` is explicitly set to `true` for a separately
  provisioned service connection.

When those hold, the job runs [`get-github-app-token.yml`](/eng/common/core-templates/steps/get-github-app-token.yml),
which signs a JWT with the App's RSA key in Key Vault, exchanges it for an installation token, and
passes that token to the OneLocBuild task via `gitHubPatVariable`.

If `UseGitHubAppAuthentication` is explicitly set to `false`, or a project outside the two
supported projects does not explicitly opt in, the job uses the existing `GithubPat` parameter. This is a
template-selection fallback only: if App token minting or authentication fails after the App path
is selected, the job fails and does not retry with the PAT.

## Gaining access

"Access" means two separate things, and **both** are required:

1. **The App must be installed on the GitHub org/account that owns your target repo, and your
   specific repository must be selected in that installation.** The App can only open a PR against a
   repository it is installed on. This is what actually grants the App permission to your repo.
2. **Your pipeline must use the App path.** In `dnceng/internal` and `DevDiv/DevDiv`, leave
   `UseGitHubAppAuthentication` set to `true`. In another project, provision a project-scoped
   service connection and explicitly opt in as described below.

The .NET Engineering Services team manages the App signing key. Contact the First Responders before
enabling another Azure DevOps project so they can provision or approve a least-privilege WIF service
connection and authorize the intended pipeline.

### Step 1 — Request that your repository be added to the App installation

The App installation and the backing `dnceng/internal` service connection / Key Vault key are
managed by the .NET Engineering Services (dnceng) team. To have your repo added:

1. Identify the **GitHub org** and **repository** your OneLoc check-in PR targets. For most repos
   this is the value of the `GitHubOrg` parameter (default `dotnet`) and your repo name. If you use
   a mirrored repository, it's the `GitHubOrg`/`MirrorRepo` the PR is opened against — **not** the
   Azure DevOps mirror.
2. Reach out to the **First Responders**
   [channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3Aafba3d1545dd45d7b79f34c1821f6055%40thread.skype/First%20Responders?groupId=4d73664c-9f2f-450d-82a5-c2f02756606d&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47)
   and ask them to add your repository to the **`dotnet OneLoc Localization`** GitHub App
   installation for the appropriate org.
3. The App must have permission to open pull requests (Contents + Pull requests: read & write) on
   the selected repository. dnceng configures this as part of the installation.

> **Note:** The App is installed per GitHub organization. If your repo lives in an org where the App
> is not yet installed, dnceng will need to install and approve it in that org first, which may
> require an org owner's approval.

### Step 2 — Use the default App path

Once your repo is part of the App installation, no authentication parameter is required in the
OneLocBuild template call. For example:

```yaml
- ${{ if eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main') }}:
  - template: /eng/common/templates/job/onelocbuild.yml
    parameters:
      LclSource: lclFilesfromPackage
      LclPackageId: 'LCL-JUNO-PROD-YOURREPO'
```

Arcade automatically selects the project-scoped service connection:

| Azure DevOps project | Service connection |
|---|---|
| `dnceng/internal` | `dnceng-oneloc-githubapp` |
| `DevDiv/DevDiv` | `devdiv-oneloc-githubapp` |

The App client ID, Key Vault, and key name are also centralized in the Arcade template. A pipeline
still needs one-time authorization to use its project's connection. It can temporarily set
`UseGitHubAppAuthentication: false` to select the PAT path instead.

For a pipeline outside `dnceng/internal` and `DevDiv/DevDiv`, keep using the wrapper appropriate for that pipeline
(`templates/job` or `templates-official/job`) and explicitly select its project-scoped connection.
This example uses the official wrapper:

```yaml
- template: /eng/common/templates-official/job/onelocbuild.yml
  parameters:
    LclSource: lclFilesfromPackage
    LclPackageId: 'LCL-JUNO-PROD-YOURREPO'
    UseGitHubAppAuthenticationInOtherProjects: true
    GitHubAppServiceConnection: 'your-project-oneloc-githubapp'
```

The service connection identity needs the `Key Vault Crypto User` role on the App signing key, and
the pipeline must be authorized to use the connection.

### GitHub App parameters

| **Parameter** | **Default** | **Notes** |
|:-:|:-:|-|
| `UseGitHubAppAuthentication` | `true` | Activates the App path for GitHub repos in `dnceng/internal` and `DevDiv/DevDiv`, or in another project that explicitly opts in. Set to `false` to select the PAT path. |
| `UseGitHubAppAuthenticationInOtherProjects` | `false` | Explicitly activates the App path outside `dnceng/internal` and `DevDiv/DevDiv`. Requires separately provisioned infrastructure and an explicit `GitHubAppServiceConnection` override. |
| `GitHubAppServiceConnection` | `'dnceng-oneloc-githubapp'` | The Azure DevOps **WIF service connection** used by `dnceng/internal`. When the value remains the default, Arcade selects `devdiv-oneloc-githubapp` automatically in `DevDiv/DevDiv`. Outside those projects, opting in while retaining the default produces a template error; callers must specify their project-scoped connection. |
| `GitHubAppClientId` | `'Iv23lijBU8x3gc9lDOc9'` | The GitHub App's **Client ID** (used as the JWT `iss` claim). |
| `GitHubAppKeyVaultName` | `'EngKeyVault'` | The Key Vault holding the App's RSA signing key. |
| `GitHubAppKeyName` | `'oneloc-localization-app-key'` | The name of the RSA key inside that Key Vault (the App's private key). |

The token is minted for the installation on the `GitHubOrg` account (default `dotnet`), so make sure
`GitHubOrg` (and `MirrorRepo`, if mirroring) point at the org/repo where the App is installed.

## Verifying it works

1. Run your pipeline from a branch where the OneLocBuild job runs.
2. In the build, confirm the **`Get GitHub App installation token`** step runs and succeeds before
   the `OneLocBuild` task.
3. Confirm the check-in PR is opened by the **`dotnet OneLoc Localization`** App (the PR author will
   be the App / its bot identity).

## Troubleshooting

- **The App-token step is skipped.** The App path only activates when
  `UseGitHubAppAuthentication` is `true`, `RepoType` is `gitHub`, and the build runs in
  `dnceng/internal`, `DevDiv/DevDiv`, or explicitly sets `UseGitHubAppAuthenticationInOtherProjects: true`.
- **The pipeline pauses for service-connection authorization.** Authorize the pipeline to use
  `dnceng-oneloc-githubapp` in `dnceng/internal` or `devdiv-oneloc-githubapp` in `DevDiv/DevDiv`.
- **Token minting fails with a Key Vault authorization error.** The service connection identity
  needs the `Key Vault Crypto User` role (or at least the `Sign` action) on the App's key. Contact
  First Responders.
- **`404`/`Not Found` when requesting the installation token.** The App is not installed on the
  `GitHubOrg` account, or your repository was not selected in the installation. Complete Step 1.
- **PR fails to open on your repo.** Ensure the App has `Contents` and `Pull requests` (read &
  write) permission on the selected repository, and that your repo is included in the installation.

## Scope and limitations

- Arcade has project-scoped defaults for **`dnceng/internal`** and **`DevDiv/DevDiv`**.
  Pipelines in other projects use `GithubPat` unless they explicitly opt in with a project-scoped
  service connection and signing-key access.
