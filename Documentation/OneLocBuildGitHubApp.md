# Authenticating OneLocBuild's GitHub check-in with the GitHub App

This document explains how a repository gains access to the default **GitHub App**
authentication path for the OneLocBuild localization check-in PR. It supplements the main
[OneLocBuild in Arcade](OneLocBuild.md) documentation.

## Background

When OneLocBuild is configured for a GitHub-based repo (`RepoType: gitHub`), the task opens or
updates a pull request to check in localized files. The GitHub App authentication path mints a
short-lived installation token (`ghs_…`) at build time, avoiding a stored GitHub credential. The
repositories accessible to the token are determined by the GitHub App installation configuration
(all repositories or the selected repositories).
[GitHub installation tokens expire after one hour](https://docs.github.com/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-an-installation-access-token-for-a-github-app#generating-an-installation-access-token).

The GitHub App used for this is **`dotnet OneLoc Localization`** (owned by `@dotnet-bot`). Its only
job is to open/update the localization check-in PR on your repository.

## How it works

In [`onelocbuild.yml`](/eng/common/core-templates/job/onelocbuild.yml), the App token is minted
whenever `RepoType` is `gitHub`. OneLocBuild supports the **`dnceng/internal`** and
**`DevDiv/DevDiv`** Azure DevOps projects.

When those hold, the job runs [`get-github-app-token.yml`](/eng/common/core-templates/steps/get-github-app-token.yml),
which sends a SHA-256 JWT digest to Key Vault's RSA signing operation, exchanges the signed JWT
for an installation token, and passes that token to OneLocBuild via `gitHubPatVariable`.
The private key stays in Key Vault; the pipeline never reads a PEM private-key secret.

If App token minting or authentication fails, the job fails; there is no stored-PAT fallback.

## Gaining access

"Access" means two separate things, and **both** are required:

1. **The App must be installed on the GitHub org/account that owns your target repo, and your
   specific repository must be selected in that installation.** The App can only open a PR against a
   repository it is installed on. This is what actually grants the App permission to your repo.
2. **Your pipeline must run in `dnceng/internal` or `DevDiv/DevDiv` and be authorized to use its
   project's GitHub App WIF service connection.** That identity needs the `Sign` action on the
   App's RSA key, not read access to private-key secrets.

The .NET Engineering Services team manages the App credentials, Key Vault permissions, and
service connections.

### Step 1 — Request that your repository be added to the App installation

The App installation and backing Key Vault signing key are managed by the .NET Engineering
Services (dnceng) team. To have your repo added:

1. Identify the **GitHub org** and **repository** your OneLoc check-in PR targets. For most repos
   this is the value of the `GitHubOrg` parameter (default `dotnet`) and your repo name. If you use
   a mirrored repository, it's the `GitHubOrg`/`MirrorRepo` the PR is opened against — **not** the
   Azure DevOps mirror.
2. Reach out to the **First Responders**
   [channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3Aafba3d1545dd45d7b79f34c1821f6055%40thread.skype/First%20Responders?groupId=4d73664c-9f2f-450d-82a5-c2f02756606d&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47)
   and ask them to add your repository to the **`dotnet OneLoc Localization`** GitHub App
   installation for the appropriate org.
3. The App must have permission to open pull requests (Contents + Pull requests: read & write) on
   the selected repository. dnceng configures this as part of the installation.

> **Note:** The App is installed per GitHub organization. If your repo lives in an org where the App
> is not yet installed, dnceng will need to install and approve it in that org first, which may
> require an org owner's approval.

### Step 2 — Use the default App path

Once your repo is part of the App installation, no authentication parameter is required in the
OneLocBuild template call. For example:

```yaml
- ${{ if eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main') }}:
  - template: /eng/common/templates/job/onelocbuild.yml
    parameters:
      LclSource: lclFilesfromPackage
      LclPackageId: 'LCL-JUNO-PROD-YOURREPO'
```

The project-specific WIF service connection signs with the App's RSA key in EngKeyVault:

| Azure DevOps project | Service connection |
|---|---|
| `dnceng/internal` | `dnceng-oneloc-githubapp` |
| `DevDiv/DevDiv` | `devdiv-oneloc-githubapp` |

Each identity needs the `Sign` action on `oneloc-localization-app-key`. Each pipeline must be
authorized to use its project's service connection. The public App Client ID is configured
in the template and is not fetched from a secret.

### GitHub App parameters

| **Parameter** | **Default** | **Notes** |
|:-:|:-:|-|
| `GitHubAppServiceConnection` | `dnceng-oneloc-githubapp` | WIF service connection authorized to sign with the App's key. DevDiv automatically selects `devdiv-oneloc-githubapp` when this default is unchanged. |
| `GitHubAppKeyVaultName` | `EngKeyVault` | Key Vault holding the RSA signing key. |
| `GitHubAppClientId` | `Iv23lijBU8x3gc9lDOc9` | Public GitHub App Client ID used as the JWT issuer. |
| `GitHubAppKeyName` | `oneloc-localization-app-key` | RSA key used for server-side signing. |

The token is minted for the installation on the `GitHubOrg` account (default `dotnet`), so make sure
`GitHubOrg` (and `MirrorRepo`, if mirroring) point at the org/repo where the App is installed.

### Migrating from private-key secrets

The Key Vault RSA signing interface is restored. Local PEM signing and the
pipeline-variable credential interface are not supported.

Standard OneLoc job callers must remove `GitHubAppIdSecretName` and
`GitHubAppPrivateKeySecretName` (or the older `GitHubAppId` and `GitHubAppPrivateKey` parameters).
The defaults above select the existing OneLoc signing key. Custom Apps must instead set
`GitHubAppClientId` and `GitHubAppKeyName` to their public issuer and provisioned RSA key.
`GitHubAppServiceConnection` and `GitHubAppKeyVaultName` retain their meanings.

Direct callers of `get-github-app-token.yml` must replace `appIdSecretName` and
`appPrivateKeySecretName` with `appClientId` and `keyName`, keeping `azureSubscription` and
`keyVaultName`. The PowerShell helper accepts the corresponding `-AppClientId` and `-KeyName`
arguments. There is no local-signing or stored-PAT fallback.

Before switching a custom App, verify that its RSA key is provisioned in Key Vault,
corresponds to an active GitHub App private key, and grants the service connection the
`Sign` action. A PEM secret is not interchangeable with a Key Vault key. Do not remove
or rotate the active signing key until its replacement has passed a protected canary.
Secret Manager's `github-app-secret` PEM projection does not itself synchronize RSA keys;
rotation must coordinate the GitHub App and the Key Vault key.

## Verifying it works

Changes to the GitHub App signing path must pass a protected internal canary before
merge. Public pull-request builds intentionally cannot access the WIF service connection or App
signing key, so syntax and unit checks alone do not validate this boundary.

1. Run your pipeline from a branch where the OneLocBuild job runs.
2. In the build, confirm the **`Get GitHub App installation token`** step runs and succeeds before
   the `OneLocBuild` task.
3. Confirm the check-in PR is opened by the **`dotnet OneLoc Localization`** App (the PR author will
   be the App / its bot identity).

## Troubleshooting

- **The App-token step is skipped.** The App path activates when `RepoType` is `gitHub`.
- **Key Vault signing fails.** Confirm the pipeline is authorized to use its project's
  GitHub App service connection, the configured RSA key exists and is enabled, and the identity
  has the `Sign` action on that key. Do not grant secret-read access as a workaround.
- **`404`/`Not Found` when requesting the installation token.** The App is not installed on the
  `GitHubOrg` account, or your repository was not selected in the installation. Complete Step 1.
- **PR fails to open on your repo.** Ensure the App has `Contents` and `Pull requests` (read &
  write) permission on the selected repository, and that your repo is included in the installation.

## Scope and limitations

- Arcade supports OneLocBuild in **`dnceng/internal`** and **`DevDiv/DevDiv`**.
