> Note: This is a proposal for a strategy to build, manage and release multiple SDK bands of .NET. The proposal is part of the [Unified Build](./README.md) effort. For more context about the problem this design is trying to solve see the [Managing SDK Bands](./VMR-Managing-SDK-Bands.md) document.

# Managing SDK Bands - "Side by Side folders" proposal

This proposed solution would be to take the inverse approach and, instead of having SDK branches in the VMR, we‚Äôd organize the branches based on the shared bits (e.g. `release/9.0`). We would then place the band specific components side-by-side in folders.

This document describes the end-to-end process from developing to shipping multiple SDK bands using this model.

## Layout

For simplicity, let's consider we are synchronizing the repositories `dotnet/arcade`, `dotnet/runtime`, `dotnet/roslyn` and `dotnet/sdk` where `dotnet/runtime` and `dotnet/arcade` are the shared components.

Layout of files in the VMR would be as follows:

```sh
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ roslyn
    ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 9.0.1xx # Note: These could also be named just 2xx # dev/17.X branch of dotnet/roslyn maps here
    ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 9.0.2xx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sdk
    ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 9.0.1xx # release/9.0.1xx branch of dotnet/sdk maps here
    ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 9.0.2xx
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arcade
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ runtime
```

There could be also variations of this such as this:

```sh
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sdk
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ roslyn
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 9.0.1xx
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 9.0.2xx
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sdk
‚îÇ    ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 9.0.1xx
‚îÇ    ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 9.0.2xx
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arcade
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ runtime
```

The impact of the actual structure is not so important in the context of this design but it's an important detail to consider that will influence the usability of the VMR.

The layout has the following characteristics:

- Each repository is a folder either under `src/` or `src/shared/` in the VMR.
- Each band-specific component would have its full copy in the respective band folder. When creating a new band, the contents of `src/sdk/9.0.2xx` would be copied from `src/sdk/9.0.1xx` (with some changes described below).
  - E.g. The `dev/17.7` branch of `dotnet/roslyn` would map to `src/roslyn/9.0.1xx`
- VMR has branches for each major .NET version, e.g. `release/9.0`.
- Each commit of the VMR contains code for all SDK bands with shared components having a single copy.

> TODO: ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì What does a single band preview-time VMR look like? Single band VMR is in the `main` where we develop preview version of .NET. Would we have this layout from the start?

## Code flow

To re-iterate what the planned code flow looks like for .NET 9 (with full VMR back flow) ‚Äì the individual repositories only receive and send updates from/to the VMR and not between each other. A regular forward flow with changes going to the VMR only would look like this:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber

    participant runtime as dotnet/runtime<br />release/9.0
    participant SDK_1xx as dotnet/sdk<br />release/9.0.1xx
    participant SDK_2xx as dotnet/sdk<br />release/9.0.2xx
    participant VMR as VMR<br />release/9.0

    runtime->>runtime: Change in runtime
    runtime->>VMR: Flow of üìÑ RUN_2
    Note over VMR: üì¶ Intermediate VMR_2 is built

    par Parallel backflow of intermediates
        VMR->>SDK_1xx: Backflow of üì¶ VMR_2
        SDK_1xx-->>VMR: No-op
    and
        VMR->>SDK_2xx: Backflow of üì¶ VMR_2
        SDK_2xx-->>VMR: No-op
    end
```

The situation gets more interesting for breaking changes. Let‚Äôs imagine a situation where a change is needed in one of the bands that requires a breaking change in a shared component. For this, we assume that a change like this would be always made in the VMR where we can change both components at the same time:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber

    participant runtime as dotnet/runtime<br />release/9.0
    participant SDK_1xx as dotnet/sdk<br />release/9.0.1xx
    participant SDK_2xx as dotnet/sdk<br />release/9.0.2xx
    participant VMR as VMR<br />release/9.0

    runtime->>runtime: Change in runtime ‚û°Ô∏è RUN_2


    activate SDK_2xx
    runtime->>VMR: Flow of runtime
    activate VMR
    Note over VMR: ‚ùå Requires change<br />(in sdk/1xx and sdk/2xx)<br />Fix is made immediately
    VMR->>VMR: Change is made to sdk, creating üìÑ SDK_1.2, SDK_2.2
    deactivate VMR

    Note over VMR: üì¶ VMR_2 intermediates are built

    par Parallel backflow
        VMR->>SDK_1xx: Backflow of üìÑ SDK_1.2, üì¶ VMR_2
    and
        VMR->>SDK_2xx: Backflow of üìÑ SDK_2.2, üì¶ VMR_2
    end
```

The diagram shows:

1. A change was made in `dotnet/runtime`.
2. The change is flown to the VMR SDK branch where a PR with the source change is opened.
3. Sources of both SDK bands are changed, PR is merged.  
   Official VMR build publishes intermediate packages for each repository.  
   This triggers the next steps in parallel.
4. New sources of both bands, together with the we new runtime intermediate package are flown back to `dotnet/sdk`.
5. Same as step `4.` but for the other SDK band.

After the last step, both SDK branches have the same sources of `dotnet/runtime` which means they're coherent.

## Band snap

To create a new band, and for the ease, it would be the best to do the snap in the VMR from where it would be flown to the appropriate branches in the individual repositories:

1. Create the new band folders by copying the sources of the latest band.  
   E.g. `src/sdk/9.0.1xx` to `src/sdk/9.0.2xx`
2. Adjust versions, point the new band to the new runtime intermediate package. ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì This doesn't make sense
3. Configure Maestro subscriptions between new VMR bands and their individual repository counterparts.
4. Maestro flows the changes from the VMR and creates the appropriate branches in the individual repositories.

## Release

Release would be quite simple as it would just mean doing a full build of a single VMR commit.
