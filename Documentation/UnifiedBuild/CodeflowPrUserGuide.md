# Codeflow PR User Guide

# Codeflow PRs

Codeflow PRs are automated pull requests created by [Maestro](https://maestro.dot.net), and are generated by source-enabled subscriptions.  
These subscriptions can only be created between the [VMR (Virtual Monolithic Repository)](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/) and product repositories that have their [sources in the VMR](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/tree/main/src).  

As the name suggests, source-enabled subscriptions not only update dependencies but also synchronize source code changes **to and from** the VMR.
They ensure that repository sources remain in sync with the corresponding `src/` directory in the VMR.
Source code changes can originate in either the repository or the VMR and are synchronized to the other side via source-enabled subscriptions.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Opening PRs against the VMR is **not yet permitted** and will be allowed in the near future. For now, source code changes should only be made in the repositories, barring exceptional cases.  

For more details on codeflow and the VMR, see [VMR Code and Build Workflow](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Code-And-Build-Workflow.md).  

## Codeflow PR Metadata

The code flow mechanism relies on metadata files similarly to the existing Maestro dependency flow.
- **`eng/Version.Details.xml`**
  - A file you already know from the current dependency flow. It contains version information for dependencies between repositories. A new addition is the `<Source>` tag, used for tracking the latest codeflow from the VMR.
- **`src/source-manifest.json`**
  - A file contained in the [VMR](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/blob/main/src/source-manifest.json) that contains the last version of every repository synchronized into the VMR.

## FAQ

- **Where do packages get built?**
  - Packages are built in Unified Build pipelines. See [UB Pipelines](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build?definitionId=1330).
- **How do I find the new codeflow subscriptions?**
  - A full list of subscriptions can be found at on the [maestro.dot.net](https://maestro.dot.net/subscriptions) webpage. Subscriptions can be managed with DARC commands in the same way they always were.
- **What should I do in case of conflicts?**
  - If you have an ongoing dependency PR in your repository with additional changes/work: Finish the PR as you would normally. If there are conflicts with the newly merged backflow PRs, you may tag **@dotnet/product-construction** in your PR and we will help you resolve those.
