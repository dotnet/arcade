# Build Analysis Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I reproduce a failure?

We maintain a DevTest Lab configured with access to the same image galleries used in Helix machines that may be used for a virtual machine environment. We also keep a few duplicate of "on premesis" hardware (machines not available as a VM) available for remote access. Contact dnceng for details. 

## Is this useful even if my project does not use Helix?

Yes! The Build Analysis result leverages Azure DevOps history and information to provide context and workflow improvements. Though it may bring additional information for Helix-based execution, it is not required.
