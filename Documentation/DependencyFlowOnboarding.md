# Dependency flow onboarding

There's a set of steps that need to be completed so the versions of assets your repository depends on are updated and also the assets your repository produces are updated in upstream repositories.

- [Dependency flow prerequisites](#prerequisites)

- [Publishing dependencies](#publishing)

- [Consuming dependencies](#consuming)

## Prerequisites

These pre-requisites are not hard requirements, but enabling dependency flow will be much simpler if you are using these processes:

- Internal builds produced out of https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal

- Publishing using the [Arcade SDK](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/master/Documentation/StartHere.md#im-ready-to-get-started-what-do-i-do)

## Publishing

### Steps for publishing

#### 1. Copy the eng/ folder

Copy the `eng/` folder from the [minimalci-sample](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade-minimalci-sample) repo. 

This folder contains required version files as well as Pipeline templates used for publishing assets.

For more information about version files go to: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/master/Documentation/DependencyDescriptionFormat.md

#### 2. Enable Arcade publishing

https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/master/Documentation/CorePackages/Publishing.md

To enable Arcade publishing, you need to define some additional variables on the job which needs to publish.

A typical publish job would look something like this...

```json
variables:
  _BuildConfig: Debug
  _DotNetPublishToBlobFeed : true
  _PublishBlobFeedUrl: https://dotnetfeed.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet-core/index.json
  ${{ if and(ne(variables['System.TeamProject'], 'public'), notin(variables['Build.Reason'], 'PullRequest')) }}:
    _PublishArgs: /p:DotNetPublishBlobFeedKey=$(dotnetfeed-storage-access-key-1)
      /p:DotNetPublishBlobFeedUrl=$(_PublishBlobFeedUrl)
      /p:DotNetPublishToBlobFeed=$(_DotNetPublishToBlobFeed)
      /p:DotNetSymbolServerTokenMsdl=$(microsoft-symbol-server-pat)
      /p:DotNetSymbolServerTokenSymWeb=$(symweb-symbol-server-pat)
    _OfficialBuildIdArgs: /p:OfficialBuildId=$(BUILD.BUILDNUMBER)
  ${{ if or(eq(variables['System.TeamProject'], 'public'), in(variables['Build.Reason'], 'PullRequest')) }}:
    _PublishArgs: ''
    _OfficialBuildIdArgs: ''
steps:
# publishing requires some secrets from key vault
- ${{ if and(ne(variables['System.TeamProject'], 'public'), notin(variables['Build.Reason'], 'PullRequest')) }}:
  - task: AzureKeyVault@1
    inputs:
      azureSubscription: 'DotNet-Engineering-Services_KeyVault'
      KeyVaultName: EngKeyVault
      SecretsFilter: 'dotnetfeed-storage-access-key-1,microsoft-symbol-server-pat,symweb-symbol-server-pat'

- script: eng\common\CIBuild.cmd $(_PublishArgs) /p:OfficialBuildId=$(BUILD.BUILDNUMBER)
```

#### 3. Enable assets publishing to the Build Asset Registry (BAR)

To enable asset publishing to BAR we need to add a closing phase to `azure-pipelines.yml`. To do this add the following snippet at the end of `azure-pipelines.yml` and update the `dependsOn` parameter with the names of **all** the previous **build** jobs:

```json
  - ${{ if and(ne(variables['System.TeamProject'], 'public'), notin(variables['Build.Reason'], 'PullRequest')) }}:
    - template: /eng/common/templates/phases/publish-build-assets.yml
      parameters:
        dependsOn:
          - job1
          - job2
        queue:
          name: Hosted VS2017
```

## Consuming

### Steps for consuming

#### 1. Add or copy Version.Details.xml

Dependency consumption depends on the [details file](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/master/Documentation/DependencyDescriptionFormat.md#details-file) defining what dependencies your repo is going to consume.

You can create this file or copy the file from arcade-minimalci-sample's [Version.Details.xml](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade-minimalci-sample/blob/master/eng/Version.Details.xml) file as a starting point.

#### 2. Add or copy your expression files

Dependency flow will update versions in your [expression files](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade-minimalci-sample/blob/master/eng/Version.Details.xml).

You can create these files or copy them from the arcade-minimalci-sample repo:

- [Version.props](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade-minimalci-sample/blob/master/eng/Versions.props)

- [global.json](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade-minimalci-sample/blob/master/global.json)

#### 3. Add subscriptions and channels

More about [Channels, Branches, and Subscriptions](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/master/Documentation/BranchesChannelsAndSubscriptions.md)

[Scenarios](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/master/Documentation/BranchesChannelsAndSubscriptions.md#scenarios)

##### 3.1. Join the `arcade-contrib` team

1. Go to https://github.com/orgs/dotnet/teams/arcade-contrib/members
2. Click on "Request to join"

##### 3.2. Set up your darc client

Once you are part of the `arcade-contrib` team

1. Go to https://maestro-prod.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com/
2. Click "Sign in" in the upper right of the page
3. Give consent to "DotNet Maestro"
4. Click on your name and then on "Tokens"
5. Choose a name for your token and then "Create"
6. Copy the created token
7. Open a powershell or bash prompt and navigate to a repository that has the arcade toolset.
8. Run `.\eng\common\darc-init.ps1` or `./eng/common/darc-init.sh`.  This will install darc as a global tool.
9. Run `darc authenticate`
10. Place the token into the `bar_password` field.  You may leave the rest of the fields as-is.
11. Save and close.

##### 3.3. Get all existing channels

1. Run `darc get-channels` to display available channels.  Arcade builds are published to the '.NET Tools - Latest' channel.

##### 3.4. Create a subscription to get Arcade updates

Darc can be used to create new subscriptions, either in interactive mode or non-interactive mode.
Interactive will open an editor to modify the fields, while non-interactive expects all fields on the command line.

###### Interactive mode

1. Run `darc add-subscription`

2. Fill out the fields.  For Arcade, this typically looks like:

```
Channel: .NET Tools - Latest
Source Repository URL: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade
Target Repository URL: <your repository URL>
Target Branch: <target branch for arcade updates, e.g. master>
Update Frequency: everyDay
Merge Policies:
- Name: AllChecksSuccessful
  Properties:
    ignoreChecks:
    - WIP
    - license/cla
```

3. Save and close

###### Non-interactive mode

1. Run `darc add-subscription --channel ".NET Tools - Latest" --source-repo https://github.com/dotnet/arcade --target-repo <your repo> --target-branch master --update-frequency everyDay --ignore-checks WIP,license/cla --all-checks-passed -q`

These steps can be altered for additional subscriptions to other repositories.

##### 3.5. Create a channel (optional, typically not needed)

You only need to create a channel in  rare cases.  Most .NET Core 3 builds should be assigned to the ".NET Core 3 Dev" channel.  However, if you do need to create a new channel:

1. Run the following darc command:
   ```
   darc add-channel --name "<channel name>" --classification "<classification>"
   ```
   The classification is typically 'product'.  Later on this will be used to differentiate dev or non-product builds, etc.

##### 3.6. Associate a branch with a channel (optional)

This will associate each new build of a specific branch in a repository with a channel.

1. Run the following darc command:
   ```
   darc add-default-channel --branch refs/heads/<branch> --repo <repo URI> --channel <target channel>
   ```
   Example: For corefx master (the .NET Core 3 development branch), this would be:
   ```
   darc add-default-channel --branch refs/heads/master --repo https://github.com/dotnet/corefx --channel ".NET Core 3 Dev"
   ```
2. Verify with `darc get-default-channels`

#### 5. Validate

At this time we don't have a way to notify users if something went wrong while updating dependencies but this work is tracked by
https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/821.

To validate that created subscriptions and channels work as expected you'd need to verify that a PR has been created on your subscription's `targetRepository` once a build from `sourceRepository` has successfully completed. If a PR was not created something went wrong and we can use darc to find out what happened

1. Obtain the id of the non-functioning subscription:
   ```
   darc get-subscriptions
   ```
   You can use various parameters to filter the list and find the subscription you're interested in.  For instance:
   ```
   darc get-subscriptions --target-repo corefx
   https://github.com/dotnet/arcade (.NET Tools - Latest) ==> 'https://github.com/dotnet/corefx' ('master')
   - Id: c297d885-0692-40f8-6b97-08d61f281b4c
   - Update Frequency: everyDay
   - Merge Policies:
     AllChecksSuccessful
       ignoreChecks =
                     [
                       "WIP",
                       "license/cla"
                     ]
   - Last Build: N/A
   ```
2. Use the ID and query for the subscription history:
   ```
   darc get-subscription-history --id <id>
   ```
   For example:
   ```
   darc get-subscription-history --id d2d2e80d-8b31-4744-1959-08d6175791f6
   10/19/2018 9:15:17 AM: (Success) - Checking merge policy for pr 'https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/arcade-minimalci-sample/pulls/129'

   10/19/2018 9:05:04 AM: (Success) - Updating subscription for build '146'
   ```
   Any failed actions will be marked as such, along with a retry command.
3. Let @alexperovich, @jcagme or @mmitche know about the errors in the unsuccessful entry
