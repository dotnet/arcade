# Clarifying First Responders and Operations Epics

Work organized in three backlogs:

## FR Backlog

This is unchanged and operates as today. It prioritizes work that is

- Customer facing
- Existing service functionality broken
- Critical Priority "P0"

Its purpose is to unblock customers. That's it.

Work is expected to be short and randomizing. The FR Lead is empowered to reprioritize issues according to need.

## Operations Backlog

Operations handles ongoing work around keeping services up and running ("keeping the trains running"), including

- Important priority "P2"
- Ensure compliance with company policies, specifically 
- Implementing features to improve service maintainability
- Reducing service technical debt

Work is expected to be more "epic style" chunks that are regularly planned. 

## FR / Ops Shared Backlog (aka "FROps")

This backlog provides a home for tasks that are not immediately urgent but must still be completed with a timeframe that would be disruptive for typical epic work. 

FR draws tasks from this backlog after the regular FR backlog is empty. 

Operations draws tasks from this backlog before working on the regular Operations backlog. This means that Operations epics may be more "randomized" than regular epics.

- Customer-impacting but not critical
- High priority "P1"

Examples:

- New queues
- Resolving Component Governance issues
