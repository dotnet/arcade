| Breaking        | Change breaks a scenario, requiring an update by our customer/s |
| Disruptive      | Not necessarily breaking, but there's a high likelihood there will be some unintended fallout **OR** is a change which adds debt|
| Minimal Risk    | Probably won't break anyone or cause disruption |
| Minor, low risk | Very unlikely to to have any negative impact |
