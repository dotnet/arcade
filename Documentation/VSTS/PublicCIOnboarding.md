# Enabling Public CI and Pull Requests in VSTS

## Project Guidance

[Project guidance](./VSTSGuidance.md) - Covers guidance on naming conventions, folder structure, projects, build definitions, etc...

## VSTS Pull Request and CI Builds

[VSTS Pull Request and CI builds](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/actions/ci-build-github?view=vsts) - VSTS documentation for enabling VSTS public CI and Pull Request builds

## Agent queues

Agent queue use / configuration / etc... is likely to change very soon, at the moment, agent queues are primarily relegated to Hosted machine pools.  When VSTS enables "bring your own cloud", we'll provide greater flexibility / capacity of machines.

A couple of notes:

- Space on [Hosted machines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=vsts#capabilities-and-limitations) is only guaranteed to be at least 10 GB

- For Linux, use the "DotNetCore-Linux" machine pool instead of "Hosted Linux Preview".  "Hosted Linux Preview" is not guaranteed to have docker installed. 

## VSTS GitHub connection

VSTS will require a GitHub Service Endpoint to communicate with github and setup web hooks.  Teams should use the `DotNet-Bot GitHub Connection` Service Endpoint.  The `DotNet-Bot GitHub Connection` requires that teams add the .Net Core owned [service account](https://github.com/dotnet/core-eng/blob/master/Documentation/Project-Docs/VSTS/dotnet-bot-github-service-endpoint.md#github-service-account) as a [collaborator](https://help.github.com/articles/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository/#collaborator-access-on-a-repository-owned-by-a-user-account) (Admin access) on the GitHub repo.

For implementation details and managing information about `DotNet-Bot GitHub Connection` see the [documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/core-eng/blob/master/Documentation/Project-Docs/VSTS/dotnet-bot-github-service-endpoint.md#vsts-service-endpoint)

## CI Badge link

The [VSTS CI Build guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/actions/ci-build-github?view=vsts#create-a-vsts-build-status-with-a-github-readme-file) describes how to determine the CI build badge link, but only for task based build definitions.  If you're using a YAML based build definition, then you can determine the badge link by either of these two methods.

- Edit the build definition and go to the "History" tab.  Select the most recent change, right-click, and select "Compare Differences".  Scroll through the json and look for the "_links" section to find the "badge" link.

```JSON
"_links": {
  "self": {
      "href": "https://dotnet.visualstudio.com/9ee6d478-d288-47f7-aacc-f6e6d082ae6d/_apis/build/Definitions/15?revision=4"
  },
  "web": {
      "href": "https://dotnet.visualstudio.com/9ee6d478-d288-47f7-aacc-f6e6d082ae6d/_build/definition?definitionId=15"
  },
  "editor": {
      "href": "https://dotnet.visualstudio.com/9ee6d478-d288-47f7-aacc-f6e6d082ae6d/_build/designer?id=15&_a=edit-build-definition"
  },
  "badge": {
      "href": "https://dotnet.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/build/definitions/9ee6d478-d288-47f7-aacc-f6e6d082ae6d/15/badge"
  }
},
```

- Use the method provided in the [CI Build Guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/actions/ci-build-github?view=vsts#create-a-vsts-build-status-with-a-github-readme-file) to discover the badge link for a task based build definition in the same project, then replace the build definition id with the build definition id of the yaml based build you are modifying.  The Url encoding follows this pattern...

  `https://[project collection]/_apis/[project name]/build/definitions/[project id]/[build definition id]/badge`

It is recommended that you restrict the CI build status to a particular branch.  This will prevent the badge from reporting Pull Request build status.  Restrict to a branch by adding the `branchName` parameter to your query string.

Example:

```Text
https://dotnet.visualstudio.com/DotNet-Public/_build/index?definitionId=17&branchName=master
```

## Security

[Security documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/actions/ci-build-github?view=vsts#security-considerations)

It is recommended that you do **NOT** enable the checkbox labeled "Make secrets available to builds of forks".

## Yaml

- Code reuse

  For *most* teams, it is recommended that you author your yaml to use the [same yaml files for internal, CI, and Pull Request builds](./WritingBuildDefinitions.md).  See https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/master/eng/build.yml, for how this is being done in Arcade with build steps conditioned on "build reason".  Note that VSTS does not yet provide build reason in the template evaluation context, so it is currently explicitly provided via two entry points: [Internal builds entry point](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/master/.vsts-dotnet.yml#L5) and [CI / Pull Request builds entry point](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/master/.vsts-dotnet-ci.yml#L5)

  Expect build reason to be available for template evaluation by the end of June, 2018.  At that time, Arcade's `.vsts-dotnet.yml` and `.vsts-dotnet-ci.yml` files will be combined into a single file and the explicit "buildReason" variable will be removed.

- Shared templates

  Arcade currently provides a handful for [shared templates](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/tree/master/eng/common/templates).  At the moment, it is only recommended that you add the `base` template to your yml phases ([example](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/master/eng/build.yml#L19)).  More templates will be provided when VSTS fixes some current bugs (see "Notes about templates")

  - [base.yml](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/master/eng/common/templates/phases/base.yml) defines docker variables, and enables telemetry to be sent for non-CI builds.

- Variable groups

  Variable groups are not yet supported in Yaml.  They are scheduled to be available soon (June 2018), in the interim if you need to access a key vault secret, you can explicitly reference a key vault secret using the VSTS key vault task.

Notes about templates:

- Additional info about templates - https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-agent/blob/master/docs/preview/yamlgettingstarted-templates.md

- Currently, VSTS has a problem with multiple levels of templates where it will change the order of build steps you provide.  That means, for now, use templates judiciously, don't layer templates within templates, and always validate the step order via a CI build.

## Troubleshooting

### Queuing builds

- YAML: "The array must contain at least one element. Parameter name: phases"

  If your template doesn't compile, then it may prevent any of your "phase" elements from surfacing which leads to this error.  This error hides what the real error in the template is.  You can work around this error by providing a default phase.

  ```YAML
  phases:
  - phase: foo
    steps:
    - script: echo foo
  ```

  With a default phase provided, when you queue a build, VSTS will now tell you the actual error you care about.  VSTS is hotfixing this issue so that the lower-level issue is surfaced.

- "Resource not authorized"

  If you made some change to a resource or changed resources, but everything else *appears* correct (from a permissions / authorization point of view), and you're seeing "resource not authorized" when you try to queue a build; it's possible that the resource is fine, but the build definition is not authorized to use it.  Edit the build definition and make some minor change, then save.  This will force the build definition to re-authorize and you can undo whatever minor change you made.
