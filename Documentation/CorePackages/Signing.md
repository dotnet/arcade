# Sign Tool

This is a MSBuild custom task that provides batch signing and verification for MicroBuild environments. The tool is intended to be run as a post-build step and is able to automatically infer the files that need to be signed given a list of container files (.nupkg, .vsix, etc) as input. The high level features of this tool are:

- **Performance:** It operates as a post-build step and uses the minimum number of requests possible. This can have a dramatic performance improvement over the typical implementation which signs as a post-compile step. For example, in Roslyn it took build + sign times down from 1-2 hours to 8 minutes.

- **Automated:** It is able to recursively open container files (like .nupkg, .vsix) and create a list of nested files that need to be signed. Therefore, you don't need to manually specify which files need to be signed.

- **Containers:** It can handle the nesting issues that come with container files: both nested PE and nested containers. The tool will correctly sign the inner most content first, repack the containing package with the signed content and then sign the outermost container. Arbitrary levels of nesting are supported.

- **Post signing checks:** It takes extra steps to ensure a file is properly signed after the signing process completes. This tool parses the signed binary file to make sure the binary was modified and marked as signed.

- **Manifest generation:** When the path to a manifest file is informed the tool will create a manifest file with the list of files that *would* be signed with their respective signing information (Certificate + Strong Name).

## Arguments

| Name                      | Type      | Required | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------- | --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| DryRun                    | bool      | No       | When true the list of files to be signed will be created but won't be sent to the signing server. Default is false. |
| TestSign                  | bool      | No       | When true the binaries will be test signed. The default is to real sign. |
| ItemsToSign               | Array     | **Yes**  | This is a list of *full path* to files that need to be signed. Container files will be expanded to look for nested files that need to be signed. |
| StrongNameSignInfo        | Array     | **Yes**  | Should store the default certificate name and strong name to be used for a given Public Key Token. See details below. |
| FileSignInfo              | Array     | No       | Used to override the default certificate information for specific files and target frameworks combinations. If not specified default information is used or error occurs. See details below. |
| FileExtensionSignInfo     | Array     | No       | This is a mapping between extension (in the format ".ext") to default sign information for those kind of files. Overriding of the default sign info is done using the other parameters. |
| MicroBuildCorePath        | Dir Path  | **Yes**  | Path to MicroBuild.Core package directory.                   |
| MSBuildPath               | Exe path  | !DryRun  | Path to the MSBuild.exe binary used to run the signing process on MicroBuild. |
| PublishUrl                | Http URL  | No       | The URL of the feed where the package will be published. This is only used as complimentary information on the orchestration manifest file. |
| OrchestrationManifestPath | File path | No       | Path (including file name) to where to store a manifest file containing the list of files that would be signed and their respective signing information. If empty no manifest will be produced. |
| TempDir                   | Dir path  | **Yes**  | Used to store temporary files during the process of calling MicroBuild signing. |
| LogDir                    | Dir path  | !DryRun  | MSBuild binary log information from the signing rounds will be stored in this directory. |

**Note:** `MSBuildPath` and `LogDir` are only required if `DryRun == false`.


# Arguments Metadata

**StrongNameSignInfo**

This field needs to have the following metadata: `PublicKeyToken`, `CertificateName` and the `Include` field is assumed to hold the `Strong Name`. This information will be used as the default certificate and strong name information for all files that match the `PublicKeyToken`.

**FileSignInfo**

This field needs to have the following metadata: `PublicKeyToken`, `CertificateName`, `TargetFramework` and the `Include` field is assumed to hold a file name (including extension; not a full path). More over it also accepts the "All" sentinel to denote all target frameworks.

The `CertificateName` attribute might also contain the value "None" to flag a file that should not be signed.

All files that match the combination of (File Name, Public Key Token, Target Framework) will use the overriding Signing information informed / or ignored.


## Example Usage

The Arcade SDK will include all container files from the `$(ArtifactsPackagesDir)` and `$(VisualStudioSetupOutputPath)` folders (these properties are set [here](../src/Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk/tools/RepoLayout.props)) in the list of containers to be looked up for. Note that only projects marked with `<IsPackable>true</IsPackable>` will be packed and copied to this folder. Here is how the Arcade SDK does it:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
	<ItemsToSign Include="$(ArtifactsPackagesDir)**\*.nupkg" />
	<ItemsToSign Include="$(VisualStudioSetupOutputPath)**\*.vsix" />
</ItemGroup>
```

If you **need to** add additional file(s) make sure to add them to the `ItemsToSign` list. Default signing information (Certificate Name & Strong Name) will be looked up in the `StrongNameSignInfo` property based on the Public Key Token of the file. Therefore, make sure that `StrongNameSignInfo` contains a public key token covering the files that you add to `ItemsToSign`. Here's an example:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
	<StrongNameSignInfo Include="StrongName1" PublicKeyToken="31bf3856ad364e35" CertificateName="CertificateName1" />
</ItemGroup>
```

It is possible to override the default signing information or skip signing specific file(s). For that you need to use the `FileSignInfo` property. For instance, in the snippet below the certificate `MyCustomCert` will be used for `My.Library.dll` when it targets `.NETStandard,Version=v2.0` and has Public Key Token `31bf3856ad364e35`:

```xml
<ItemGroup> 
    <FileSignInfo Include="My.Library.dll" TargetFramework=".NETStandard,Version=v2.0" PublicKeyToken="31bf3856ad364e35" CertificateName="MyCustomCert" />
</ItemGroup>
```
In this snippet the library `Other.Library.dll` with Public Key Token `31bf3856ad364e35` won't be signed, independent of its Target framework:

```xml
	<FileSignInfo Include="Other.Library.dll" TargetFramework="All" PublicKeyToken="31bf3856ad364e35" CertificateName="None" />
</ItemGroup>
```
For more detailed information you can see [how](../src/Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk/tools/Sign.proj) the Arcade SDK calls the `SignToolTask`. Here's a snippet:

```xml
...
<Microsoft.DotNet.SignTool.SignToolTask
    DryRun="$(DryRun)"
    TestSign="$(TestSign)"
    ItemsToSign="@(ItemsToSign)"
    StrongNameSignInfo="@(StrongNameSignInfo)"
    FileSignInfo="@(FileSignInfo)"
    TempDir="$(ArtifactsTmpDir)"
    LogDir="$(ArtifactsLogDir)"
    PublishUrl="$(PublishUrl)"
    OrchestrationManifestPath="$(OrchestrationManifestPath)"
    MSBuildPath="$(DesktopMSBuildPath)"
    MicroBuildCorePath="$(NuGetPackageRoot)microbuild.core\$(MicroBuildCoreVersion)"/>
...
```

## Valid of Argument Values

**Certificate Name:** name of the Authenticode certificate to use for signing.  Valid values include `Microsoft402`, `WindowsPhone623`, `MicrosoftSHA1Win8WinBlue` and `VsixSHA2`.  

**Strong Name:** name of the key to use when strong naming the binary. This can be `null` for values which do not require strong name signing such as VSIX files. 

**Target Framework:** valid values include (but are not limited to): `.NETStandard,Version=v2.0`,  `.NETFramework,Version=v4.6.1`, `.NET Core,Version=v2.0`, etc.
