# .NET Core 3 Engineering transition status

## Primary Deliverables / Work Streams

1. Using Azure DevOps for CI
2. Using shared toolset (Arcade SDK)
3. Engineering dependency flow
4. Internal builds from dnceng

Target completion date for these workstreams is 12/14/2018.

### Vatsan Madhavan

#### WPF

The following work items are used to track work completion:

- [Using Azure DevOps for CI](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/701)

- [Using shared toolset (Arcade SDK)](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/699)

- [Engineering dependency flow](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/698)

- [Internal builds from dnceng](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/700)


The Arcade migration plan will be completed in two phases:

- Phase 1: Migration of dotnet-wpf Repo

- Phase 2: Migration of dotnet-trusted Repo 


At the end of each phase, full migration would be completed for the corresponding repo, which includes the use of Azure DevOps, shared toolset (Arcade SDK), engineering dependency flow, and use of dnceng based internal builds. 



| Phase                                                | Est. Completion Date | Status                                                       | Notes                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| 1. Migration of dotnet-wpf Repo and its internal clone | Dec 4, 2018          | The dotnet-wpf repo will be set-up on dnceng using the shared toolset (Arcade SDK), and will use Azure DevOps. This work is currently being prototyped and is expected to be deployed by Dec 4th. | No known project risks at this time. |
| 2. Migration of dotnet-trusted Repo                   | Jan 31, 2019        | New C++/CLI support for .NET Core is being added in Dev16 Preview 2. We are testing this in Nov/Dec 2018, and will be prototyping our repo migration to shared toolset (Arcade SDK) during this time. The actual repo migration will happen in Jan 2019 on dnceng. At the end of this, we expect to be using Azure DevOps as well.|   There are some inherent risks here because we depend on untested/new techologies - notably C++/CLI support in Dev16. We also depend on the fact that this will get into Dev16 Preview 2 without delays or major bugs, and that we can set up Azure DevOps and setup to depend on Dev16 Preview 2.|
