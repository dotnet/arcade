# Standup Guidelines

* Standups should be both in-person and Teams meetings
* Standups occur twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays
* All team members are expected to attend standup, except when there are conflicts
* Standups can and will be preempted by meetings like all hands, Q&As, other org/division-wide meetings, and holidays.
* The in person standup will take place in the team room, and the person running the meeting should share their screen on the television in the team room.
* Where possible, an external mic should be used for the standup meeting so that those joining by Teams can hear everyone at the in person meeting.
* Standup will use the [Standup View](https://github.com/orgs/dotnet/projects/86/views/10) of the .NET Core Engineering Services board.
  * The board should be organized such that it is grouped by the assignee, with issues in the Backlog (no status) or Done columns not shown.
  * FR issues are also not shown on the Standup view 
  * All team members are responsible for updating their issues to make sure they are assigned to them and the status of the issues set
* All team members are encouraged to stand during standup, but sitting is ok as well.
* Standup should focus on quick status updates, with implementation details handled offline where possible.
* While off topic conversations are fun and a good part of our culture, they should be kept to the end of the meeting so that people who need to leave can leave, without feeling like they may miss out on important business
