# Make Hybrid Work.....work

**TL;DR:** Recognize that coming into work does not necessarily imply coding. Rather, coming into socialize and collaborate in person is very important in itself.

As we experiment and experience the realities of hybrid, many of you are noticing what research is also showing – namely that solid work relationships are very important, and that hybrid/remote work can have a negative effect on those relationships.

Given this, we agree to **designate one day a week where everyone in Redmond agrees to make best effort to come into the office for the express purpose of collaborating and socializing with the rest of the team.**

**Agreement Specifics:**
- We will each do our reasonable best to be present each Thursday from 11am to 2pm for the express purpose of interacting with others, collaborating, chatting, and otherwise connecting - often informally - with our co-workers. 
- No coding is expected during this time.  (of course, it's alright to code too...)
- When on First Responder, taking care of our customers takes priority.
- It is understood that some are remote, and we should continue to be intentionally inclusive for those as well wherever and however possible.

**Principles:**
1. Relationships are an important and necessary part of our work here at Microsoft and should be prioritized as such.
2. Relationships are easier to maintain and build on when there's consistent face-to-face interactions where possible.
3. Social/collaborative interactions with our co-workers should be prioritized as an important part of our job - e.g. work.

**Rationale:**

Research is showing more and more that social interactions are more of a "must have" than a "nice to have".  In a recent write up from Microsoft Research ([Great Expectations: Making Hybrid Work Work](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/great-expectations-making-hybrid-work-work)), there are some interesting quotes in section 5 of the report.

_One of the most felt aspects of remote and hybrid work is the impact it&#39;s had on our relationships. _[_Last year&#39;s Work Trend Index_](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/hybrid-work)_ revealed that teams became more siloed, and this year's study shows the trend one year later._

_When people trust one another and have [social] capital, you get a willingness to take risks, you get more innovation and creativity and less groupthink - Nancy Baym, Principal Researcher, Microsoft Research_

_When work-life balance is out of whack, most people cut out relationship-building for more urgent matters,&quot; says Constance Noonan Hadley, an organizational psychologist who studies workplace relationships. &quot;Regardless of remote status, building relationships will still feel like a luxury workers cannot afford unless there is a shift in how time is prioritized and valued by managers_
