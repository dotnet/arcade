# Documentation Guidelines

All documentation should be added to the `dotnet/arcade` repository, [Documentation folder](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/tree/main/Documentation). Please follow any procedures for adding new documentation to this folder as you would if you were adding the documentation to the soon-to-be-deprecated `dotnet/core-eng` repo. (For example, following the procedure in the One-Pager template regarding where project one-pagers should live.)

**NOTICE**: Use your best judgement to exclude documentation that may have security implications. When in doubt, talk to the team or use placeholders in your pull requests to add documentation as not to accidentally expose sensitive information. 

If you have documentation that contains sensitive information that external-to-Microsoft folks should not have access to, then that documentation should be linked to from the public documentation and it should be placed in the Azure DevOps dnceng/internal wiki.
