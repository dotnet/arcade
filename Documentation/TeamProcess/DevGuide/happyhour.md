# Hybrid Happy Hours

- Happy Hours should be both Teams and physical meetings. A nearby conference room should be booked for as many recurrences as possible.
    - The meeting owner should have calendar reminders to make sure they book re-book the conference room for the next batch of recurrences every few months.
- Just like regular meetings, bringing laptops to Happy Hours is encouraged. This facilitates better face-to-face interaction with people who are participating on Teams.
    - Coincidentally, it's also useful for Jackbox.
- Any games projected on the screen should also be screen-shared on Teams.
    - Bring a capture card for console games (if possible; Jon owns one).
    - Games should ideally allow remote participants to play as well; Jackbox games are a great example of this. However, it's totally okay to sometimes play something that's
      not entirely remote-friendly (look, Jon really likes destroying everyone at Mario Kart), but even then, make sure it's screen-shared.
    - If a game supports neither screen-sharing nor online multiplayer, it's best not to play it.
- Pop in and pop out at will &ndash; no need to feel like you have to stay for the full two hours! This applies to both virtual and in-person participants.
    - Relatedly, feel free to continue working while attending &ndash; we love to have you there even if you can't participate in whatever games we're playing.
