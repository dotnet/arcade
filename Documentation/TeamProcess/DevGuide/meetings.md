# Meetings

## Introduction
In this new hybrid world there are many challenges ahead.  This is our current attempt as a team to navigate.  We know we're wrong at least in some ways, but will bravely move forward, learn, and then adjust as appropriate.

## Principles
- All of our meetings must be inclusive of everyone who wants to participate.
- Meetings should be reserved for situations and discussions that are unreasonable or silly to have async.
- Meetings are an important, necessary, and key part of belonging.
- Social interactions are also a priority.  (not just the agenda)
- Nobody should feel like they *only* go to meetings all day

## Guidelines
- Every meeting is a Teams meeting.  (regardless if synchronous or async)
- Meetings should start after the hour (or half hour) so that folks have breathing space in between. At least five minutes are recommended, and ten minutes if reasonable.
- Every meeting has recording turned on by default
- A meeting agenda articulating what is hoped to be accomplished is highly encouraged.
- Notes that articulate the main points discussed and conclusion are sent out after every meeting that is of general concern.  (1:1's don't count of course)
- When folks are meeting physically together, laptops (or other devices) should be used to aid remote folks.  (see logistics note below)
- The meeting organizer should *always* have a laptop.
- Attendees (remote and in-person) should use the "hand raise" feature to request time to speak. The meeting organizer should monitor and use this list.
- The meeting organizer should monitor Teams chat for relevent meeting information and especially funny memes.
- It's probably better to schedule meetings in a conference room and/or focus room so as to not disrupt the team room.  However, there are undoubtedly times when having the meeting in the team room is appropriate.
- Only one person should speak at a time
  - Modern conference room microphones are sensitive. Even quiet side conversations come through clearly to remote attendees.
  - Simultaneous speakers in a conference room quickly become incoherent to remote attendees and make it difficult to understand individuals. 
- Close meetings on time. Conference rooms may be booked by others, which can cause an abrupt ending (and remote folks do not get to participate in the wrap-up hallway conversations that can happen after).

## Logistics
- A pool of laptops is available which can be 'checked out' and used for meetings.  At this time, there's probably not enough for everyone, but we do have a few already.  Also, most devs now already have a laptop which is helpful.
- Meeting notes:
  - V-Team meeting notes are posted in the v-team channel in Teams.
  - Inter-Team notes are sent to the invite list.
  - General team meeting notes are sent to the whole team alias.
