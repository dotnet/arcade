# Meetings

## Introduction
In this new hybrid world there are many challenges ahead.  This is our current attempt as a team to navigate.  We know we're wrong at least in some ways, but will bravely move forward, learn, and then adjust as appropriate.

## Principles
- All of our meetings must be inclusive of everyone who wants to participate.
- Meetings should be reserved for situations and discussions that are unreasonable or silly to have async.
- Meetings are an important, necessary, and key part of belonging.

## Guidelines
- Every meeting is a Teams meeting.  (regardless if synchronous or async)
- Every meeting has recording turned on by default
- Notes that articulate the main points discussed and conclusion are sent out after every meeting that is of general concern.  (1:1's don't count of course)
- When folks are meeting physically together, laptops (or other devices) should be used to aid remote folks.  (see logistics note below)
- The meeting organizer should *always* have a laptop.
- It's probably better to schedule meetings in a conference room and/or focus room so as to not disrupt the team room.  However, there are undoubtedly times when having the meeting in the team room is appropriate.

## Logistics
- A pool of laptops is available which can be 'checked out' and used for meetings.  At this time, there's probably not enough for everyone, but we do have a few already.  Also, most devs now already have a laptop which is helpful.
- Meeting notes:
  - V-Team meeting notes are posted in the v-team channel in Teams.
  - Inter-Team notes are sent to the invite list.
  - General team meeting notes are sent to the whole team alias.
