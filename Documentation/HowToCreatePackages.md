# How to Create an Arcade Package

One of the goals of Arcade is to be a vehicle to provide code sharing. One of the ways to accomplish this is to pack each tool into its own NuGet package. This document assumes that you are adding a package called `ProjectOne` to Arcade and provides a list of things you should check while doing that.

## Things to Check

- Package sources must go into the `src\` folder on the root of the repository.

- Inside the `src\` folder create a folder representing the project namespace: `src\Microsoft.DotNet.ProjectOne`.

- The main sources for the package must go into `src\` folder. That is:

  `src\Microsoft.DotNet.ProjectOne\src`

- The sources for unit tests should go side-by-side with the main sources.

  `src\Microsoft.DotNet.ProjectOne\tests`

- You should include a `README.md` file on the root of the package.

- Make sure the namespace prefix of the package follows the name of the project. For instance:

  `namespace Microsoft.DotNet.ProjectOne.Model`

- Include the package on the `Arcade.sln` file. This way it will be compiled automatically when the solution is built.

- Make sure that library dependencies of the new package use the Arcade defined version of the library. The versions are defined in the [`..\eng\Version.props`](../eng/Versions.props) file. For instance, if the project has a dependence on Newtonsoft.Json you must add it as follows:

  `<PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="$(NewtonsoftJsonVersion)" />`

  If there is no version specified for a required library feel free to add a new property defining it.

- If your package produces binaries that need to be signed, make sure to mark it as <IsPackable>true</IsPackable> or check the SignTool [documentation](../src/Microsoft.DotNet.SignTool/README.md) to see how to sign specific files.

- If the package needs to target a version of .NET Framework we recommend you to use the Arcade defined version, which is stored in the $(NetFxTfm) property. For instance:

  `<TargetFrameworks>$(NetFxTfm);netcoreapp2.0</TargetFrameworks>`

- There is no requirement to create a separate `.nuspec` file for the package. The package information will be automatically extracted from the `.csproj` file.
