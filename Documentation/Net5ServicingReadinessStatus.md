# .NET 5 Servicing Readiness Status

Repo owners are asked to do the following:

- Prepare or flow ‘RTM’ code changes and build of each repo that has stable branding (5.0.0) – For those core repos that have shipping packages, prepare code changes with StabilizePackageVersion set to ‘true’ and build. **Do not assign the build to a channel.** See https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/eng/Versions.props#L15-L16 for the typical location where this lives. Verify that branding looks correct in all produced assets (do the correct packages have stable branding?) This applies to the following repos:
  - Runtime
  - Aspnetcore
  - Windowsdesktop
  - Extensions
  - Efcore
  - installer
  - winforms
  - wpf
  - templating
- Prepare ‘RTM+1’ changes+build (5.0.1) - For those repos with incremental servicing (extensions, runtime, windowsdesktop, aspnetcore), prepare code changes and a build on top of the RTM change that ship some minimal set of packages that would be expected on month to month. **Do not assign the build to a channel.** The runtime, aspnetcore, and windowsdesktop repos should not produce a targeting pack. For those repos that incrementally service some packages outside the shared framework, increment a patch version for one package and ship it. This applies to the following repos:
  - runtime
  - extensions
  - windowsdesktop
  - aspnetcore
- Prepare a targeting pack fix (5.0.2) – For those repos that produce targeting packs, make a “fake” servicing fix to the targeting pack and prepare code changes that would have this fix. Create a build with these changes. **Do not assign the build to a channel.** This applies to the following repos:
  - aspnetcore
  - runtime
  - windowsdesktop

For those repos that really only change a single patch number per-release (efcore, sdk, etc.), please prepare the following:
- A branding update for 5.0.1, and 5.0.2. You do not need to build this. This applies to:
  - sdk
  - wpf
  - wpf-int
  - winforms
  - efcore
