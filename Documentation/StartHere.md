# Jumping into .NET Core 3 Infrastructure

The purpose of this document is to provide a jumping off point for repository
owners looking to start upgrading their infrastructure to .NET Core 3. It will
provide a general overview of the direction .NET Core 3 infrastructure is going
and a general outline of steps you should take to get started with the upgrade,
with links to appropriate detailed documentation.

## What are we doing?

With every new major product cycle, we take the chance to upgrade our
infrastructure based on what we learned in the previous product cycle. The goal
is to produce a better product more efficiently in the next product cycle.  .NET
Core 3 is no different, though in many ways the infrastructure changes we are
making are much more an overhaul than normal.  Generally, we are focusing in 3
areas:
- **Shared tooling (Arcade)** - Striving to reduce duplication of tooling,
  improve development consistency between repos and drive tooling improvements
  across a wider swath of the ecosystem more quickly.
- **Transitioning to Azure DevOps for public CI, and upgrading official builds**
  - Move away from Jenkins, improve CI reliability, increase the consistency
  between our official and PR builds, and bring first-class workflow for
  internal as well as public changes.
- **Improving our inter-repo dependency version management (Darc)** - Improve
  the rate at which dependencies are updated in repos, improve content
  tracability, etc.

## Does my repository need to be involved?

Generally, if your repo is shipping in .NET Core 3, yes.  For ['Tier
1'](TierOneRepos.md) repos a full transition is required.  While there exist
some special cases (e.g. repos used as submodules in aspnet/universe), we're
striving to move as many people towards the new infrastructure as possible.
- If you use .NET CI (ci.dot.net, ci2.dot.net, ci3.dot.net) you'll need to move
  into Azure DevOps.
- If you pull new dependencies from other repos (e.g. latest
  Microsoft.NETCore.App package), you'll need to onboard onto Arcade and
  dependency flow.
- If you publish dependencies used by other repos, you'll need to onboard onto
  Arcade, so that other repos may consume your outputs.

## I'm ready to get started, what do I do?

See the [Arcade Onboarding](Onboarding.md) guide.

Additionally, the WinForms team has documented their path to adopt Arcade from scratch, including moving their repositories public. Their guide can be found here: [Arcade - Starting from Scratch](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/MerriesWinFormsandSetup/EdJpqtiLVdtFuS6p10E0o_IBVu2WsETAd4zBf6YdVKsLcQ?rtime=MyHzd7Rx1kg)

## Where can I find general information on .NET Core 3 infrastructure?

There is quite a bit of documentation living under the
[Documentation](../Documentation/) folder in the dotnet/arcade repo.  Here are
some highlights
