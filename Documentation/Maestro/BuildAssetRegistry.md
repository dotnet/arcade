# Build Asset Registry

The database containing build asset version information, channels, and subscriptions used by [DARC], [Maestro], and [MC]

## Requirements
* [Build]s can be assigned to one or more [Channel]\(s)
* [Channel]s and [Build]s can be either private or public
* Public Repositories cannot subscribe to private [Channel]s
* Private [Build]s cannot be assigned to a Public [Channel]
* [MC] can get full dependency graph of a [Build]

## Scenarios

1. [Query](#query)
1. [Add](#add)
1. [Update](#update)

### Query

1. Get latest [Build] of a repository for a channel
    * Used by [Darc] to determine if a dependency needs to be updated

1. Get repositories that subscribe to updates from a [Repository] intended for a [Channel]
    * Used by [Darc] to flow dependencies when a [Build] is assigned to a [Channel]

1. Get a Specific [Build]
    * Used by [MC]

1. Get dependencies of a [Build]
    * Used by [MC] to show dependency tree for a [Build]

### Add

1. Push new [Asset] and [Build] information
    * Used by repository build once new assets are ready for consumption

1. Create new [Channel]\(s) and [Subscription]\(s)
    * Used by [Maestro] and [Darc] for product release, feature branch creation, and dev PR scenarios

### Update

1. Assign existing [Build] to a [Channel]
    * Used by [Maestro] based on repo policy
    * Used by [Darc] when asked by devs

1. Create/Edit/Delete existing [Subscription]\(s), [Channel]\(s) and [Build]\(s)
    * Used by users

## Definitions

### Subscription
Represents a specific repository branch's desire to receive updates from another repository on a specific [Channel].
```csharp
class Subscription {
    string ChannelName;
    string SourceRepository;
    string TargetRepository;
    string TargetBranch;
    SubscriptionPolicy Policy;
}
```

### Subscription Policy
Represents the policies that are applied to a [Subscription].
```csharp
class SubscriptionPolicy {
    UpdateFrequency UpdateFrequency; // "every day", "every build", ...
    MergePolicy MergePolicy; // "when green", "unit tests passed", "never", ...
}
```

### Channel
A Channel contains a set of builds
```csharp
class Channel {
    string Name;
    string Classification; // "Official", "DevBuild", "PR Validation", ...
}
```

### Build
Identifies a specific build of a repository.
```csharp
class Build {
    string Repository;
    string Commit;
    string BuildNumber;
    DateTimeOffset DateProduced;
    List<Channel> Channels;
    List<Asset> Assets;
    List<Build> Dependencies;
}
```

### Asset
A specific Asset including when it was produced and where it can be found.
```csharp
class Asset {
  string Name;
  string Version;
  Build ProducedBy;
  List<AssetLocation> Locations;
}
```

### Asset Location
A feed or other publish mechanism where a specific [Asset] can be found.
```csharp
class AssetLocation {
    string Location;
    LocationType Type; // "NuGet Feed", "Blob Container", ...
}
```
