# Maestro GitHub web hooks

Some GitHub repositories have commit web hooks pointing at Maestro. The dotnet/versions commit hook is used for build-info change notifications, and individual repos can use commit hooks to trigger CI builds.

For example, Core-Setup release/1.0.0 and release/1.1.0 pipebuilds. GitHub sends a commit callback to Maestro, then Maestro queues the VSTS build.

## Finding web hook settings

On the repository page, go to the **Settings** tab and click **Webhooks**. You may need to click on a dropdown to find **Settings** due to ZenHub.

If you don't see **Settings** anywhere, you don't have permission. Check https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/DotNet/repos to see who has admin permission.
