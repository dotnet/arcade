# Renovate Dependency Update Tool

## Introduction

This document outlines the integration of [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) into Arcade to automate dependency updates.
Renovate is an automated dependency update tool that generates PRs for updating dependencies from a wide variety of sources.

Renovate is similar to Dependabot in its purpose.
Dependabot should be used when possible.
However, Renovate supports a much broader range of [dependency types](https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/datasource/), most notably Docker and GitHub releases.
For example, Renovate can automatically generate a PR to update a referenced Docker image when a newer version is available.

### Example Scenarios

Here are two scenarios demonstrating the usefulness of Renovate automatically making dependency updates:

#### Container Tags

Repos that reference container tags from the [dotnet/dotnet-buildtools-prereqs-docker](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-buildtools-prereqs-docker) repo need to maintain those tags to ensure they are supported.

This can be as simple as automatically updating to a new major version of Linux distro:

```diff
-mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet-buildtools/prereqs:debian-11-helix-amd64
+mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet-buildtools/prereqs:debian-12-helix-amd64
```

Or automatically pinning to the latest version of a tag by it's digest value:

```diff
-mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet-buildtools/prereqs:debian-12-helix-amd64@sha256:b99da50c4cb425e72ee69c2b8c1fdf99e0f71059aee19798e2f9310141ea48fb
+mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet-buildtools/prereqs:debian-12-helix-amd64@sha256:6bb6fef390e6f09a018f385e346b0fe5999d7662acd84ca2655e9a3c3e622b71
```

Renovate can detect when these new container images are available and submit PRs to update sources accordingly.

#### GitHub Release

There are many cases where a version of OSS published via GitHub releases is being referenced by a .NET repository.
Those versions can be kept updated automatically as new releases occur.

For example, there are Dockerfiles in the [dotnet/dotnet-buildtools-prereqs-docker](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-buildtools-prereqs-docker) repo which reference the LLVM version that can be maintained by having Renovate automatically check for new [LLVM releases](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases).

```diff
-LLVM_VERSION=19.1.7
+LLVM_VERSION=20.1.0
```

## Design

### Fork Mode

Protecting GitHub repositories in the dotnet organization from direct access by the Renovate tool is crucial.
Renovate will be used in fork mode, limiting its permissions to forked repositories.
This avoids giving write permissions to Renovate on any dotnet repository.
This means that Renovate acts as though it's any other outside contributor, not requiring any special permissions in the dotnet organization or repositories.

A GitHub bot account, `dotnet-renovate-bot`, is used to manage the Renovate operations.
This account has the ability to create forks from dotnet repositories, which will be the source of the head branch for PRs that are created.
The PRs generated by Renovate will be done using this bot account.
Renovate also handles synchronization from the upstream branch automatically.
GitHub scopes required by this account: `repo`, `workflow`.

### Repo Usage

Arcade provides an Azure DevOps pipeline YAML job template that repositories should utilize when making use of Renovate.
This template handles the execution of Renovate, ensuring a standardized approach across all repositories.
Repositories wishing to make use of Renovate can reference this template from a pipeline YAML file, setting the schedule trigger as desired.
Consuming repositories are responsible for providing their own [Renovate configuration file](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/) that describes which dependencies should be updated.

Repositories are in control of how often Renovate will run via the pipeline schedule trigger (once a day, once a week, etc).
Typically, a pipeline would be configured to update all dependencies at once in which case all dependencies are described in one Renovate config file.
But in some cases, it may be desired to have certain dependencies updated on a different schedule than others.
In that case, the repo maintainer would define multiple pipelines with those separate schedules, all configured to run Renovate.
Importantly, each of those pipelines would need to reference a separate Renovate config file which defines the scope of the updates that will be targeted.
Lastly, a maintainer is free to manually run the pipeline if an expected update is needed right away.
